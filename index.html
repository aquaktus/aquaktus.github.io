      <h2>Oct 2019 - now: PhD at the University of Glasgow</h2>
        
        <p>I am developing new machine learning methods to deepen human-machine collaboration by breaking 
            down structured tasks like programming into a conversation. My adviser is 
            <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/staff/jeffdalton/">Jeff Dalton</a> at the 
            Glasgow Representation and Information Learning Lab.
            
            My fundamental motivation is to build agents capable of deep collaboration to achieve 
            complex goals through conversation to enhance rather than substitute humans.</p>

    <h2>2015 - 2019: Bachelor in Computing Science at the UofG</h2>
    <p>I graduated with ​First Class Honours in Computing Science where, in my last year, I focused on Algorithmics and Artificial Intelligence 
        and defended my thesis on using deep recurrent networks for language conditioned code generation. 
        
        Along the way I squeezed in two summer internships at <a href='https://hibirdi.com/'>Birdi</a>, an AI Startup in satellite imagery where I worked in a great team led by Sivakumaran S. as a ​research scientist 
        in computer vision helping push ML models to production. 
        
        The research also included high performance data visualizations for customer 
        click data leading to a novel sweep line pruning algorithm that was presented at UCL.</p>
